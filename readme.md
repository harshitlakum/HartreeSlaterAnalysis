# HartreeSlaterAnalysis

This repository introduces two fundamental methods for constructing wave functions in multi-electron quantum systems: the **Hartree product** and **Slater determinants**. These concepts are essential in quantum chemistry for understanding electron configurations and antisymmetry principles.
